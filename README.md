## Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_Using_R

In this case, a new credit card company has entered the Western market of the United States. As one of the most secure company’s products, its credit card, the transactions must be safe and transparent internally and externally. Assume that we are a junior data scientist who was hired to identify instances of fraud during the transaction. This is our first task to help the company develop a feasible solution to better detect the pattern of fraud in credit card transactions and increase the overall safety consciousness.

Our goal for this project is to predict fraud detection with different variables by using the dataset. To find out the accuracy of the model and fulfilled the questions we want to explore in our cases, we can have a clear picture of this event. 

To sum up, according to the problem of credit card fraud transactions, we will dive into this dataset and see if we can dig out more useful information during the project.

### Introduction

There are two datasets already split as training and testing dataset. In our case, we chose train dataset as our main dataset. Due to the similarity and consistency of data, there are slightly differences between two of them. To briefly introduce this dataset, we will start with its dictionary before data scaling and cleaning. First, we selected the necessary columns for the analysis and drop personal information, such as first name and last name.
